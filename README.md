# Texquisite Corpse

_Texquisite Corpse_ is a text-based online Exquisite Corpse game.

Exquisite Corpse was invented by surrealist artists in France as early as 1918. In any version of the game, a group of players contribute something - a drawing or a sentence, usually - in turn. Then everybody's contribution is combined in order. Read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse).

In this version, each player contributes a sentence and passes the device over to someone else, who only sees a fragment of the sentence. Everybody adds something, and then basks in the beauty of their collective nonsense whenever they're ready.

I'd like to build on this project with a drawing element, where a fragment of each player's drawing is shown to the next player â€“ this is probably the most popular way to play the game IRL.
